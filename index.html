            <p>I'm currently a Master's of Electrical Engineering student at Stellenbosch University focusing on autonomous underground robots. I graduated my Bachelor's of Mechatronics Engineering degree with honours from Nelson Mandela University in 2023. I have a keen interest in various areas of engineering, with a particular focus on robotics engineering. Additionally, I have a few proficient technical skills, especially in MATLAB, C, C#, and Python, and I have a solid academic foundation in mathematics and physics.</p>

                <h3>MEng Research Project (2024-2025)</h3>
                <p>My master's research focuses on developing a robust system for underground exploration, integrating SLAM, different sensors, feature identifications and localizations with 2D and 3D mapping. It aims to enhance efficiency and safety by implementing exploration, inspection, and feature extraction algorithms for identifying key structures in underground environments.

                <h3>Final Year (BEng) Research Project (2023)</h3>
                <p>My honour's research project focuses on the development of a winch-controlled temperature probe system integrated on an autonomous boat, with sensors, microcontrollers, safety mechanisms and navigation. Testing showcased the system's capability to acquire temperature profiles in relatively shallow waters while compensating for heaving motions.

                <h3>Water Quality Monitoring Project (2023)</h3>
                <p>In this project, I developed a system using a PLC to automate the control of the water valves based on sensor readings. The system monitored water quality parameters, including turbidity, pH, temperature, and conductivity, to ensure optimal water conditions. By adjusting the valve switches in response to sensor data, the system maintained the desired quality levels.</p>

                <h3>BRICS Drone Project (2023)</h3>
                <p>For this project, a 250-size drone was built from scratch, integrating essential hardware components such as the flight controller, ESC, motors, and propellers. The flight control system was configured using a Flysky FS-I6S remote controller and fine-tuned with Betaflight. This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into drone design, electronics, and flight dynamics.</p>
